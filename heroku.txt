Step by step guide on how to create and host an application on heroku

// Regular Nodejs application
1. Installation command - npm install -g heroku // No matter which directory someone's in, typing this command will install it globally and can be accessed from any directory

2. At this step someone needs to create a heroku account by going in their website/web interface

3. Logging in command - heroku login // Running this command will prompt user to put his/her credentials

4. Creating an application command - heroku create // Running this command will create an application on heroku server and provide the user the application url

5. Displaying the git remote repositories command - git remote -v // Running this command will show the results that will look like the followings
heroku  https://git.heroku.com/infinite-reaches-89868.git (fetch)
heroku  https://git.heroku.com/infinite-reaches-89868.git (push) 
origin  https://github.com/srahman3311/abc-backend.git (fetch)   
origin  https://github.com/srahman3311/abc-backend.git (push)

6. Adding a Procfile command - touch Procfile // touc Procfile command will create a file Procfile without any file extension
7. At this step user needs to add this line in Procfile - web: node app.js // web: node app.js means it's nodejs web application and need to run using node app.js command
8. Adding an environtment variable command - heroku config:set API_KEY=sfhsdfhsr6885dadhjfs // Adding multiple environment variables are simply not allowed
9. Pushing the application to heroku command - git push heroku main // It will push everthing to heroku server and application will run

// Updating an application
1. All we have to do is commit the changes using git and after that run the command git push heroku main // Don't forget to push it to your github repo before pushing it to heroku
